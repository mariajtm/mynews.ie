          Jeremy Renner has made his first late night US television appearance since his serious snowplough incident on
          New Year’s Day. The Marvel star, 52, made his entrance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night with the
          assistance of a cane,
          and was given a standing ovation by audience members. It comes shortly after the airing of his first TV
          interview since the incident, during which he sat down with
          US journalist Diane Sawyer to share the details of what had happened. <a

          Actress Hilary Swank has given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. The 48-year-old Million Dollar Baby star
          posted a photo of her and her twins looking at the sunset on Instagram on Sunday (Apr 9) evening with the
          caption: “It wasn't easy. But boy (and girl!) was it worth it.”She added on Instagram that she's "posting from
          pure heaven”. She and entrepreneur Philip Schneider have been married since 2018. Over the course of her
          pregnancy, Swank had been filming her new show Alaska Daily. She shared in an interview in October that when
          her pants didn't fit during filming, she cut them open and put a jacket on to hide her bump. <a

        <p>
          Shakira has "begged" members of the media to respect her children's privacy, speaking "not as an artist, but
          as a mother". The Columbian pop singer, 46, acknowledged there is a high level of interest in her own life but
          requested that her two sons, Milan, and Sasha, be allowed to live a "healthy and happy life". Shakira has been
          the subject of much tabloid attention recently after reports she ended her relationship with footballer Gerard
          Pique, with whom she shares her children. She is also set to face charges of tax fraud after a Spanish judge
          approved a trial last year. Shakira has
          denied all wrongdoing. In a lengthy Instagram post, written in Spanish on Monday, the singer addressed
          journalists and members of the
          media. <a

          “THE OSCARS ARE predictable, we already know who’s going to win.” Across the past few days in LA, film
          insiders were pretty convinced that we already knew how this year’s
          Oscars would turn out. Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed by the Daniels (as the film’s two creators
          are collectively known), would clean up. Ireland wasn’t about to win a sweep of awards despite being nominated
          for 14. And yet. We held on to a bit of hope. Granted, those who know their Oscars stats weren’t making their
          predictions based on nothing. But hadn’t we seen Oscar shocks before? (And we don’t just mean Will Smith’s
          behaviour last year). We dared to dream: Could Ireland actually see a few surprise wins? <a

          Millie Bobby Brown and her partner Jake Bongiovi have sparked engagement rumours with their latest Instagram
          posts. Excited fans are congratulating the couple after the 19-year-old Stranger Things actress and rock star
          Jon Bon Jovi's son shared pictures featuring a large diamond. The Instagram post, which has millions of likes,
          with a black and white photo of the couple, was captioned with lyrics from Taylor Swift's song "Lover". The
          post read: "I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all." In the photo, the actress is seen
